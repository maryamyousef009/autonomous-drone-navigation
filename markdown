# Autonomous Drone Navigation using AI
This project uses AirSim, YOLOv5, and Python to simulate an autonomous drone navigating through a virtual environment with real-time obstacle detection.
## Features
- AirSim drone control
- YOLO-based obstacle detection
- Python automation for takeoff, flight, and landing
## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- airsim
- opencv-python
- torch
- numpy
## Getting Started
1. Install Unreal Engine 4.27
2. Clone AirSim repo and set it up
3. Run `main.py` to test drone control
